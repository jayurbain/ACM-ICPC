     A -  Efficiency of Binary Search

Solutions should run very quickly (less than one second) problems 
A, B, D, E, F, G and H, and in 5 seconds or less for problems C and I.  
Time limits for problems A, B, D, E, F, G and H will be ten (10) 
seconds, and for problems C and I the time limits will be 60 seconds.  
Recognizing that all computers are different but still needing to 
apply some absolute standard, these time limits are already set well 
beyond what should be expected, so please do NOT allow additional time 
(though out of curiosity judges may check to see how much longer a 
solution might take.)
 
I have worked to get test data that will bog down brute force 
approaches to those problems where we donâ€™t want that to be acceptable.  
My brute force solutions to a few problems run in well over a minute 
when the efficient algorithm is under a second.
